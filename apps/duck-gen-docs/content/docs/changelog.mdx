## February 2026

### Documentation Restructure

The duck-gen documentation was completely restructured for clarity and discoverability.

#### New Section Layout

The docs are now organized into clear sections:

| Section | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| **Duck Gen** | Core generator -- overview, configuration, API routes, messages, generated types |
| **Duck Query** | Type-safe HTTP client -- overview, client methods, types, advanced usage |
| **Guides** | End-to-end walkthrough from setup to production |
| **Templates** | Starter projects with Duck Gen pre-configured |

#### Duck Query Documentation

Added a complete **Duck Query** section covering the type-safe HTTP client that consumes Duck Gen's generated types:

- **Overview** -- What Duck Query is and how it connects to Duck Gen output
- **Client Methods** -- Every method (`get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`) with typed request/response examples
- **Types** -- Deep dive into `RouteReq`, `RouteRes`, `ApiRoutes`, and utility types
- **Advanced** -- Custom interceptors, error handling, retry logic, and SSR patterns

#### Mermaid Diagrams

Added architecture flowcharts showing how Duck Gen processes source code:

- **Main flow diagram** -- From `duck-gen.json` config through ts-morph scanning to `.d.ts` output
- **Route extraction pipeline** -- How controller decorators are parsed into typed route maps
- **Message extraction pipeline** -- How `@duckgen` JSDoc tags become typed message registries

#### Callout Enhancements

All callout blocks now include contextual icons for better visual scanning throughout the documentation.

#### API Reference Tables

Every configuration option, type, and method is now documented in formal tables with types, defaults, and descriptions.
