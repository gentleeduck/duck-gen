## What is Duck Gen?

Duck Gen is a general-purpose compiler extension in the @gentleduck ecosystem. It scans
server code and emits TypeScript definitions that describe API routes and message keys.
It is designed for multiple frameworks and is currently being tested with NestJS. The goal
is simple: keep server contracts and client types aligned without manual sync work.

If you have ever shipped a client without matching route types or drifted i18n
keys, Duck Gen removes that pain.

<Callout icon={<Lightbulb/>} title="Think of it this way">
  Duck Gen is like a translator that reads your server code and writes a dictionary
  your client can use. Every time the server changes, you re-run the translator and
  your client instantly knows the new vocabulary.

## The Human Behind the Duck

[@wildduck2](https://github.com/wildduck2) is the architect behind [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck).
He's not interested in building another abandoned open-source graveyard. He's obsessed with
creating tools that developers actually want to use performant, maintainable, and battle-tested in
production environments.

He's also criminally responsive to community feedback. Got a bug? It gets fixed. Got a feature
request that makes sense? It gets seriously considered. No corporate bureaucracy, no waiting three
quarters for a minor patch. Just direct, honest development.

The entire [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck) organization exists because modern web
development shouldn't feel like assembling IKEA furniture in the dark. Every library, every tool,
every decision is made with one question: "Does this actually help developers ship better products
faster?"

## Why Duck Gen Exists

Typed routes and message keys should not be a manual chore. As a general-purpose compiler
extension, Duck Gen automates the contract layer so you can focus on building features.

**What you actually get:**

- **Typed routes, end to end**: Generate request and response types directly
  from framework controllers (currently tested with NestJS).
- **Message key safety**: Keep i18n dictionaries aligned with the constants you
  declare in code.
- **Configurable scanning**: Point Duck Gen at your `tsconfig.json` and let its
  include/exclude globs define the scan surface.
- **Warnings with intent**: Duck Gen surfaces duplicate message const names and
  `any` returns so you can fix contracts early.
- **Built for automation**: Run it locally or in CI. Generated files are safe
  to overwrite.

<Callout icon={<Zap/>} title="Zero runtime cost">
  Duck Gen only produces `.d.ts` files -- pure type declarations. There is no runtime
  library, no bundle size impact, no performance overhead. Types are erased at compile time.
